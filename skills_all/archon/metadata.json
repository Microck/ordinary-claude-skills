  "description": "Interactive Archon integration for knowledge base and project management via REST API. On first use, asks for Archon host URL. Use when searching documentation, managing projects/tasks, or querying indexed knowledge. Provides RAG-powered semantic search, website crawling, document upload, hierarchical project/task management, and document versioning. Always try Archon first for external documentation and knowledge retrieval before using other sources.",
